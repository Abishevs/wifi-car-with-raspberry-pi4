## Conection frontend to backend
* Using ajax and javascript to send data on every button click or keystroke press.
* Keystrokes(wasd and arrows, space or escape for stop) P.S speed up and down not implemnted yet
* 
## Future fix of delay from frontend
Use socket.io and get bi-direcation connection to the server. This way sending data will be 
very low latency.
